# Missing Maps Hackathon: Detection of vegetation loss

This notebook demonstrates work of Jan Benetka and Jakub MatÄ›jka carried out during the first [**Missing Maps & MSF Hackathon**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/missing-maps-hackathon-pilsen-hackathon-s-lekari-bez-hranic-registration-74140796117) organized in the Czech Republic. The goal of the challenge is to identify rural locations with potential population growth. 

Expansion of population in certain area is almost always accompanied with side effects such as increased number of houses and consequent emergence of paths among them, loss of trees in nearby forests (used for heating or cooking), or degradation of natural environment due to the industrial growth. A common denominator of all of these effects is a decrease of vegetation mass. Our aim, therefore, is to provide **simple yet effective methods to detect loss of greenery and analyze its rate**.
